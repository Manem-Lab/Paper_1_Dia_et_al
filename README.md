This repository contains the code used in the study "Cross-scale Association of Radiological and Pathological Imaging for Immunotherapy Biomarker Discovery in NSCLC Patients." The research explores the correlation between CT radiomics and histopathology-derived pathomics features in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with immunotherapy. The dataset includes 36 patients with both radiology and pathology images, and the features were analyzed for their association with clinical outcomes such as survival and immune markers (CD8 counts). Methods include the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for distribution comparison and unsupervised clustering to identify survival-related patterns. The code allows for reproducing the statistical analyses, feature extraction, and clustering performed in the study to further understand multimodal biomarker development for personalized cancer treatment.
